        Fullstack application built with the Express.js, React library and redux
        to manage state. The application is hosted on Render and uses MongoDB as
        database. The application is a Ecommerce store that keeps track of
        orders and verfies order ID with OCR scanner and the payment
        transactions using PayPal. The application includes user authentication,
        and advanced middleware.

        With this project, I&apos;ve tried to understand various security
        aspects of web development. I&apos;ve learned a lot about fullstack
        development and RESTful APIs; how to handle production databases, how to
        manage sessions on client-side but also perform appropriate validations
        server-side, how to validate user input, email verifications, etc.

        A useful and simple service that allows users to perform CRUD
        operations. This API is built with Express.js and secured with JWT and
        tested endpoints on POSTMAN.

        <br />
        The data is fetched and parsed with json provided with the course of
        backend specialization by IBM, It has authentication and authorization.
        This project was also the first time I implemented a RESTful API and
        understood the importance of securing your API routes.

        This RAWG clone application built as a side project to improve my
        frontend knowledge and implement infinite scrolls and passing queries.
        This application is built with React and TypeScript.js. Hosted on
        Netlify.

        <br />
        Built in TypeScript, this project introduced me to another powerful tech
        to add into my arsenal, UI built in chakra for the application, I
        learned a lot about RTK query, Zustand and infinite query.
