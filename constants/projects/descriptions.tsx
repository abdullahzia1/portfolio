        Fullstack application built with the Express.js, React library and redux
        to manage state. The application is hosted on Render and uses MongoDB as
        database. The application is a Ecommerce store that keeps track of
        orders and verfies order ID with OCR scanner and the payment
        transactions using PayPal. The application includes user authentication,
        and advanced middleware.

        With this project, I&apos;ve tried to understand various security
        aspects of web development. I&apos;ve learned a lot about fullstack
        development and RESTful APIs; how to handle production databases, how to
        manage sessions on client-side but also perform appropriate validations
        server-side, how to validate user input, email verifications, etc.

        The data is fetched and parsed with json provided with the course of
        backend specialization by IBM, It has authentication and authorization.
        This project was also the first time I implemented a RESTful API and
        understood the importance of securing your API routes.
